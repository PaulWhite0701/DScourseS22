\section{LASSO Results}

The optimal value of $\lambda$ is .000869. This is from an in sample RMSE of .0714. The resultant out of sample RMSE is .170.

\section{Ridge Results}

The optimal value of $\lambda$ is .0233. The in sample RMSE that yielded this was .0699. The out of sample RMSE is .173.


You would not be able to run a linear regression with more columns than rows, as there would be more terms than data rows. 


The models are likely somewhat overfit. They used the entire set of variables and have around twice the RMSE.
